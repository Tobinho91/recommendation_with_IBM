## Recommendations with IBM

In this project, the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles have been analyzed.

### Introduction

The goal of the project is to perform recommendations of the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform is performed.

#### Steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis 
2. Rank Based Recommendations
3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
4. Content Based Recommendations 
5. Matrix Factorization

#### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Recommendations-with-IBM/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb

or
